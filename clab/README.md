## Basic C Programming Lab consists of two components:

1. Component-1 is under `mini/` subdirectory. Complete the code in `part[1-8].c` files. Test them 
individually (e.g. test part1 by typing `build/part1`) and altogether (by typing `./grade-lab`).


2. Component-2 is under `scratch/` subdirectory.  Write 2 independent C programs from scratch. 
Each program should be in its separate directory with a Makefile: `avgcsv/`, `gameoflife/`.
